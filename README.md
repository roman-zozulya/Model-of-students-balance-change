# Model of students balance change

Our task is to model the change in the balance of students. Balance is the number of lessons each student has.
To check if everything is right with our data and to make a list of hypotheses and questions, 
it is important to understand:
- how many lessons were on the balance of all students for each calendar day;
- how this number changed under the influence of transactions (payments, accruals, corrective write-offs) 
  and lessons (write-offs from the balance as lessons were completed)
We also want to create a table where there will be balances of each student for each day.  

The result should be a query that collects data on student balances for each day they live.
Each step will be commented during the code.
